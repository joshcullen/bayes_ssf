This is the most up-to-date version of the Bayesian step selection function that includes a conditional multinomial distribution to compare *available* pixels of a raster landscape against *used* pixels. This model takes results from the resistance/speed model of the `resist_avg` repo as input. Further details are included within the "ideas3" Word doc.
